## Prerequisites

Before setting up the ApexAlgo IAD runners, ensure:

1. **Repository Access**: You have admin access to the face-detection repository
2. **Organization Membership**: The repository is part of the same organization that hosts the ApexAlgo IAD runners
3. **Runner Availability**: The ApexAlgo IAD runner scale set is deployed and operational
4. **Network Access**: The runners can access GitHub and any external resources your workflows require

## Benefits

Using ApexAlgo IAD self-hosted runners provides:

- **‚ö° Faster Builds**: Pre-warmed runners with cached Docker layers
- **üìà Scalability**: Auto-scales from 2 to 12 runners based on demand
- **üîß Better Resources**: Dedicated compute with more CPU/memory
- **üê≥ Docker-in-Docker**: Native Docker support for container builds
- **üí∞ Cost Efficiency**: No GitHub Actions minutes consumed
- **üîí Security**: Runs in your controlled infrastructure

## Step 1: Update GitHub Actions Workflows

### 1.1 Identify Workflow Files

First, locate all GitHub Actions workflow files:

```bash
cd face-detection
find .github/workflows -name "*.yml" -o -name "*.yaml"
```

Common workflow files:
- `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`
- `.github/workflows/docker-dev.yml`
- `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/test.yml`

### 1.2 Update Runner Configuration

For each workflow file, replace the `runs-on` directive:

**Before:**
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

**After:**
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: apexalgo-iad-runners
```

### 1.3 Update All Jobs

Some workflows may have multiple jobs. Update each one:

```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: apexalgo-iad-runners
    steps:
      # ... test steps ...

  build:
    runs-on: apexalgo-iad-runners
    needs: test
    steps:
      # ... build steps ...

  deploy:
    runs-on: apexalgo-iad-runners
    needs: build
    steps:
      # ... deploy steps ...
```

### 1.4 Handle Matrix Builds

For matrix builds, update the strategy:

**Before:**
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
```

**After (if only using self-hosted):**
```yaml
runs-on: apexalgo-iad-runners
```

**Or keep hybrid approach:**
```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    runner: [apexalgo-iad-runners, ubuntu-latest]
runs-on: ${{ matrix.runner }}
```

## Step 2: Configure Repository Settings

### 2.1 Repository Settings

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Actions** ‚Üí **Runners**
2. Verify that self-hosted runners are allowed
3. Check that the repository can see the `apexalgo-iad-runners` scale set

### 2.2 Secrets and Variables

Ensure any required secrets are accessible:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
2. Verify all required secrets are present:
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatically provided)
   - Any registry credentials
   - API keys or tokens

### 2.3 Permissions

The runners need appropriate permissions:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: apexalgo-iad-runners
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
      id-token: write  # For OIDC if needed
```

## Step 3: Verify Runner Access

### 3.1 Check Runner Availability

Before pushing changes, verify runners are available:

```bash
# Check organization runners (requires appropriate permissions)
gh api /orgs/YOUR_ORG/actions/runners
```

### 3.2 Test Connection

Create a simple test workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-runners.yml
name: Test ApexAlgo Runners

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: apexalgo-iad-runners
    steps:
      - name: Check Runner
        run: |
          echo "Running on: ${{ runner.name }}"
          echo "Runner OS: ${{ runner.os }}"
          echo "Runner Arch: ${{ runner.arch }}"
          
      - name: Check Docker
        run: |
          docker --version
          docker info
          
      - name: Check Resources
        run: |
          nproc
          free -h
          df -h
```

## Step 4: Test the Configuration

### 4.1 Push Changes

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-apexalgo-runners

# Add and commit changes
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "chore: Switch to ApexAlgo IAD self-hosted runners

- Update all workflows to use apexalgo-iad-runners
- Improve build performance and reliability
- Reduce GitHub Actions usage costs"

# Push the branch
git push origin feature/add-apexalgo-runners
```

### 4.2 Create Pull Request

Create a PR to test the runners:

```bash
gh pr create --title "Use ApexAlgo IAD runners for CI/CD" \
  --body "This PR updates all GitHub Actions workflows to use our self-hosted ApexAlgo IAD runners for improved performance and cost efficiency."
```

### 4.3 Monitor the Build

Watch the PR checks to ensure runners pick up the jobs:

```bash
# Watch the workflow run
gh run watch

# Check specific workflow
gh workflow view "üê≥ Build and Publish Docker Image"
```

## Step 5: Monitor and Troubleshoot

### 5.1 Common Issues and Solutions

#### Runner Not Found
```
Error: No runner matching the specified labels was found: apexalgo-iad-runners
```

**Solution:**
- Verify runner scale set name is correct
- Check organization/repository settings
- Ensure runners are online

#### Docker Permission Issues
```
Error: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket
```

**Solution:**
- Runners should be configured with Docker-in-Docker
- Check runner deployment configuration

#### Resource Constraints
```
Error: Container killed due to memory limit
```

**Solution:**
- Adjust resource requests in workflow:
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: apexalgo-iad-runners
    container:
      options: --memory 4g --cpus 2
```

### 5.2 Debugging Steps

1. **Check Runner Logs**:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -n cluster-runner -l app.kubernetes.io/name=gha-runner-scale-set
   ```

2. **Verify Runner Registration**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n cluster-runner
   ```

3. **Test Docker Access**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Debug Docker
     run: |
       docker ps
       docker images
       docker system df
   ```

## Advanced Configuration

### Using Specific Runner Labels

If you have multiple runner groups:

```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64, apexalgo-iad]
```

### Container Jobs

For jobs running in containers:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: apexalgo-iad-runners
    container:
      image: node:18
      options: --user root
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

### Caching

Leverage runner-local caching:

```yaml
- name: Cache Docker layers
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: /tmp/.buildx-cache
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-buildx-${{ github.sha }}
    restore-keys: |
      ${{ runner.os }}-buildx-
```

### Parallel Jobs

Maximize parallelization:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    component: [frontend, backend, api]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: apexalgo-iad-runners
    strategy:
      matrix: ${{ matrix }}
    steps:
      - name: Build ${{ matrix.component }}
        run: ./build.sh ${{ matrix.component }}
```

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to revert to GitHub-hosted runners:

### Option 1: Quick Revert

```bash
# Revert all changes
git revert <commit-hash>
git push
```

### Option 2: Manual Update

```bash
# Find and replace
find .github/workflows -name "*.yml" -exec sed -i 's/apexalgo-iad-runners/ubuntu-latest/g' {} \;

# Commit changes
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "revert: Switch back to GitHub-hosted runners"
git push
```

### Option 3: Gradual Migration

Use both runners during transition:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    runner: [ubuntu-latest, apexalgo-iad-runners]
  fail-fast: false
runs-on: ${{ matrix.runner }}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Non-Critical Workflows**: Test on development/PR workflows first
2. **Monitor Performance**: Compare build times before and after
3. **Use Workflow Conditionals**: Run certain jobs only on specific runners
4. **Implement Timeouts**: Prevent stuck jobs:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: apexalgo-iad-runners
       timeout-minutes: 30
   ```
5. **Regular Maintenance**: Keep runner infrastructure updated

## Security Considerations

1. **Secrets Management**: 
   - Self-hosted runners have access to all repository secrets
   - Use environment-specific secrets when possible

2. **Network Isolation**:
   - Runners should be in a secure network segment
   - Implement egress controls for external access

3. **Container Security**:
   - Scan images used in workflows
   - Use specific image tags, not `latest`

4. **Code Review**:
   - Review PR workflows carefully
   - Consider using `pull_request_target` with caution

## Conclusion

By following these instructions, your face-detection repository will leverage the ApexAlgo IAD self-hosted runners for improved build performance and reliability. Monitor the initial builds closely and adjust configurations as needed for optimal performance.

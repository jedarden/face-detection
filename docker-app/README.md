## 🚀 WebAssembly (WASM) Performance

### 🔍 How to Verify WASM is Running

**Quick Visual Check:**
- Look for the green "🚀 WASM ACTIVE" badge in the UI
- Should show "Backend: wasm | SIMD ✓ | Threads ✓"

**Browser Console Check:**
```javascript
// Press F12 → Console tab, then type:
tf.getBackend()
// Should return: "wasm"
```

**Performance Indicators:**
- FPS: 20-30+ (vs 5-10 with JavaScript)
- Detection time: <50ms (vs 200-400ms with JavaScript)

**Verification Tools:**
```bash
# Command line verification
npm run verify:wasm

# Performance benchmarks
npm run benchmark:wasm

# Open browser verification tool
open verify-wasm.html
```

**Network Tab Check:**
- F12 → Network tab → Filter by "wasm"
- Should see: `tfjs-backend-wasm.wasm` being loaded

For detailed verification guide, see [VERIFY-WASM.md](VERIFY-WASM.md)

### Why WASM?

The v2.0.0 release introduces WebAssembly optimization for dramatic performance improvements:

- **8-20X faster** inference on CPU-only devices
- **Consistent performance** across different browsers
- **Better compatibility** - works without WebGL
- **Lower memory usage** - efficient linear memory model

### Backend Comparison

| Feature | JavaScript | WebGL | WASM | WASM+SIMD |
|---------|-----------|-------|------|-----------|
| CPU Inference | 200-400ms | N/A | 20-50ms | 15-35ms |
| GPU Required | No | Yes | No | No |
| Browser Support | All | Most | All Modern | Chrome 91+ |
| Memory Usage | High | Medium | Low | Low |
| Consistency | Variable | GPU-dependent | High | High |

### Enabling WASM

WASM is enabled by default in the webpack build. Users can:

1. **Switch backends via UI:**
   - Look for the "Backend" dropdown in the control panel
   - Select between WASM, WebGL, or CPU
   - App automatically reloads models with the selected backend

2. **Verify WASM is active:**
   - Check for green "🚀 WASM ACTIVE" status badge
   - Use browser console: `tf.getBackend()` should return "wasm"
   - Run verification: `npm run verify:wasm`

3. **Optimal performance:**
   - Use Chrome 91+ or Firefox 89+ for SIMD support
   - Ensure HTTPS for SharedArrayBuffer (multi-threading)
   - Modern CPU with SIMD instructions

**Migration:** See `WASM-MIGRATION.md` for technical details and migration guide.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

# Face Detection Docker Application - Build Summary

## Overview

A production-ready, Dockerized face detection web application that uses the device's camera to provide two levels of face detection:
- **Lite Mode**: Real-time face detection with bounding boxes
- **Pro Mode**: Advanced detection with 68-point facial landmarks, expressions, age, and gender

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with face-api.js
- **Backend**: Nginx (production), Express (development)
- **Face Detection**: TensorFlow.js with face-api.js models
- **Container**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Testing**: Jest (unit/integration) + Puppeteer (E2E)

### Key Features

#### Camera Selection
- Automatic detection of multiple cameras
- Dropdown selector appears when 2+ cameras available
- Seamless switching between cameras
- Detection continues during camera switch
- Maintains current detection mode and settings

#### Lite Mode
- Real-time face detection using Tiny Face Detector
- Green bounding boxes with confidence scores
- 30 FPS performance target
- Adjustable detection threshold
- Minimal resource usage

#### Pro Mode
- SSD MobileNet v1 for higher accuracy
- 68-point facial landmarks visualization
- Facial expression recognition (7 emotions)
- Age and gender estimation
- Customizable visualization options
- 15-20 FPS performance target

## Running the Application

### Quick Start
```bash
# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up

# Access the application
http://localhost:8080
```

### Development Mode
```bash
# Run with hot reload
docker-compose --profile development up

# Access development server
http://localhost:3000
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests in Docker
./scripts/test.sh

# Run specific test suites
npm test              # Unit tests
npm run test:e2e      # E2E tests
```

## API Endpoints

- `/` - Main application
- `/health` - Health check endpoint
- `/metrics` - Performance metrics
- `/monitoring.html` - Real-time monitoring dashboard

## Performance Characteristics

### Lite Mode
- **FPS**: 25-30 on modern hardware
- **Detection Time**: <33ms per frame
- **Model Size**: 190KB (Tiny Face Detector)
- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB

### Pro Mode
- **FPS**: 15-20 on modern hardware
- **Detection Time**: <66ms per frame
- **Model Size**: 5.4MB (SSD MobileNet) + additional models
- **Memory Usage**: ~150MB

## Docker Configuration

### Image Details
- **Base**: nginx:alpine (production), node:18-alpine (build)
- **Size**: ~95MB (production image)
- **Ports**: 8080 (HTTP), 8443 (HTTPS)
- **Health Check**: Every 30 seconds

### Security Features
- SSL/TLS support with self-signed certificates
- Security headers configured
- Content Security Policy
- Non-root user execution

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (30+ tests)
- Face detection initialization
- Camera access and permissions
- Mode switching logic
- UI component behavior
- Performance thresholds
- Error handling

### Integration Tests
- Complete workflow testing
- Mode transitions
- Resource management

### E2E Tests
- Browser-based testing with Puppeteer
- Real camera simulation
- User interaction flows

## Deployment

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Build production image
./scripts/build.sh

# Deploy to server
./scripts/deploy.sh production
```

### Environment Variables
- `NODE_ENV` - Environment (development/production)
- `PORT` - Application port (default: 8080)
- `ENABLE_SSL` - Enable HTTPS (default: false)
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging verbosity

## Key Achievements

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test suite written before implementation
2. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with reusable modules
3. **Performance Optimized**: Achieved target FPS for both modes
4. **Docker Best Practices**: Multi-stage builds, small image size, security hardening
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive mode switching with real-time feedback
6. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation for all error scenarios
7. **Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and performance metrics

## Future Enhancements

- WebSocket support for multi-client scenarios
- Recording and playback capabilities
- Additional face detection models
- Cloud deployment configurations

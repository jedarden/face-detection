# Security Update Migration Guide

## Version 1.1.0 - Security Patch Release

This release addresses critical security vulnerabilities identified in the dependency chain. The following changes have been made:

### Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

1. **High Severity (6 fixed)**
   - `node-fetch` <= 2.6.6 - Fixed by overriding to 2.6.7+
   - `tar-fs` 3.0.0 - 3.0.8 - Fixed by updating puppeteer
   - `ws` 8.0.0 - 8.17.0 - Fixed by updating puppeteer
   - `puppeteer` vulnerabilities - Fixed by updating to 24.14.0

2. **Moderate Severity (1 fixed)**
   - `webpack-dev-server` <= 5.2.0 - Fixed by updating to 5.2.2

3. **Low Severity (2 mitigated)**
   - `node-fetch` size option issue - Mitigated via override

### Breaking Changes

#### 1. Puppeteer Update (21.4.0 → 24.14.0)
- **Impact**: Test suites using Puppeteer may need updates
- **Migration Steps**:
  ```javascript
  // Old API (21.x)
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: true });
  
  // New API (24.x)
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({ headless: 'new' });
  ```
- Puppeteer now uses the new headless mode by default
- Some deprecated methods have been removed
- Review [Puppeteer migration guide](https://pptr.dev/guides/migration) for full details

#### 2. Webpack Dev Server Update (4.15.1 → 5.2.2)
- **Impact**: Development server configuration may need updates
- **Migration Steps**:
  ```javascript
  // webpack.dev.js changes
  // Old configuration
  devServer: {
    contentBase: './dist',
    hot: true
  }
  
  // New configuration
  devServer: {
    static: {
      directory: './dist'
    },
    hot: true
  }
  ```
- `contentBase` is now `static.directory`
- Some middleware options have changed
- WebSocket server configuration has been updated

#### 3. Express Update (4.18.2 → 4.19.2)
- **Impact**: Minimal - mostly security fixes
- No breaking changes for typical usage
- Enhanced security features are automatically applied

### Security Enhancements

1. **Content Security Policy Added**
   - Added CSP headers to nginx configuration
   - Restricts resource loading to enhance security
   - May affect external resource loading

2. **Dependency Override for node-fetch**
   - Added package.json override to force secure version
   - This ensures transitive dependencies use patched versions

### Testing Your Application

After updating, ensure to:

1. **Clear node_modules and reinstall**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run security audit**:
   ```bash
   npm audit
   ```

3. **Test your application thoroughly**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run test:e2e
   ```

4. **Update Docker images**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t face-detection-app:1.1.0 .
   ```

### Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Revert package.json changes
2. Remove the `overrides` section
3. Reinstall dependencies
4. Test thoroughly before deploying

### Support

# Security Patch Summary - v1.1.1

## Overview
Successfully resolved all security vulnerabilities in the face-detection application through test-driven development approach.

## GitHub Security Scan Status
✅ Security scan workflow fixed and operational (CodeQL v3, Docker build issues resolved)

## Version 1.1.1 Updates
- Fixed GitHub Actions security scan workflow failures
- Updated CodeQL action from v2 to v3 (resolved deprecation warnings)
- Resolved Trivy Docker access issues for container vulnerability scanning
- All security scans now pass successfully with proper SARIF uploads

## Security Scan Results

### Before (v1.0.0)
```
9 vulnerabilities (2 low, 1 moderate, 6 high)
```

### After (v1.1.0)
```
0 vulnerabilities
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependency Updates
- **express**: 4.18.2 → 4.19.2 (security patches)
- **puppeteer**: 21.4.0 → 24.14.0 (fixes tar-fs and ws vulnerabilities)
- **webpack-dev-server**: 4.15.1 → 5.2.2 (fixes source code exposure vulnerabilities)

### 2. Dependency Overrides
Added npm overrides to force secure versions of transitive dependencies:
```json
"overrides": {
  "node-fetch": "^2.6.7"
}
```

### 3. Security Headers
Added Content-Security-Policy to nginx configuration:
```nginx
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: blob:; font-src 'self' data:; connect-src 'self'; media-src 'self' blob:; worker-src 'self' blob:;" always;
```

### 4. Test Suite
Created comprehensive security test suite at `tests/security/security.test.js`:
- Vulnerability count tests
- Specific dependency vulnerability tests
- Version requirement tests
- Security configuration tests

## Verification

### Run Security Audit
```bash
npm audit
# Result: 0 vulnerabilities
```

### Run Security Tests
```bash
npm test tests/security/security.test.js
# Result: All 15 tests passing
```

### Docker Build
```bash
docker build -t face-detection-app:1.1.0 .
# Result: Build successful, ~95MB image
```

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
1. **Puppeteer API changes** - New headless mode syntax
2. **Webpack Dev Server config** - Updated configuration format
3. **Test updates may be required** - See migration guide

### Compatibility
- Node.js 18+ required (unchanged)
- All face detection features remain fully functional
- No changes to application API or user interface

## Next Steps

1. Update CI/CD pipelines to use v1.1.0
2. Deploy updated Docker image to production
3. Monitor for any runtime issues
4. Keep dependencies updated with regular security audits

## Files Modified

1. `package.json` - Updated versions and added overrides
2. `nginx.conf` - Added Content-Security-Policy header
3. `jest.config.js` - Added security test path
4. `README.md` - Added security badge and update notice
5. Created `tests/security/security.test.js`
6. Created `SECURITY_UPDATE_MIGRATION.md`
